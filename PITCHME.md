# *Does* Stack Overflow Suck?

---

### It depends

---

## Stack Overflow is *read* optimized

99.999% of SO interactions are read-only

---

## Stack Overflow is a work of *reference*

If your post would be out of place on Wikipedia, it's out of place on Stack Overflow

---

# How to succeed

---

## 1. Perception

- Downvotes are not personal |
- Closure is not personal |
- Duplicates generally are duplicates (you may not have reduced your problem) |

---

## 2. Before asking...

- Reduce your problem |
- Research your problem |
- *Debug* your problem |
- Learn English |
- Search Stack Overflow (with Google, not SO) |

## 3. Before answering...
